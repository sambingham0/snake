# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of game development. This project aims to create an engaging Snake game that emphasizes fundamental programming concepts and provides a fun user experience. 

The game is a classic Snake game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food while avoiding self-collision and the game boundaries. The objective is to collect as much food as possible to achieve a high score. Players can navigate the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard.

My purpose in writing this software is to apply the knowledge I have gained in Python and game development, and to create a functional project that I can showcase in my portfolio.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **Pygame**: A library for creating games in Python, which provided the necessary functions for graphics and sound.
- **Python**: The programming language used to write the game logic and manage the game flow.

# Useful Websites

Here are some resources that helped me throughout this project:
* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
* [Real Python - Pygame Tutorial](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and future enhancements for this game:
* Add levels of increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
* Implement a pause feature to allow players to take breaks during gameplay.
* Enhance the graphics and animations for a more engaging visual experience.
